# A collection of the major projects I undertook while in the computer science program at the University of Minnesota. 
### Most projects began with some professor-written starter code to confine the code to a certain skeleton, but the functionality of every project was written solely by me, or by the team specified in the README.
### A few projects may require access to the university provided lab machines, due to database interaction or due to being designed for a specific type of linux machine (projects written in C).
